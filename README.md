This repository showcases a subtle bug in Java involving the `continue` statement within a `while` loop.  The bug arises from the loop's counter not being incremented when the `continue` statement is executed. The solution demonstrates a correction ensuring proper loop termination.  The code is straightforward, focusing on highlighting the specific error and its resolution. The bug might seem trivial, but it exemplifies a common class of errors that can arise from improper handling of loop control statements.
